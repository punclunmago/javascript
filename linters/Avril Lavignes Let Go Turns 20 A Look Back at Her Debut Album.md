*Let Go* showcased Lavigne's pop-punk style and rebellious attitude, as well as her songwriting skills. She co-wrote most of the songs on the album with producers and collaborators such as The Matrix, Clif Magness and Scott Spock. The album also featured some bonus tracks and soundtrack songs, such as "Why", "Get Over It", "Falling Down" and "I Don't Give".
 
To celebrate the 20th anniversary of *Let Go*, Lavigne released a special edition of the album on June 3, 2022, featuring remastered versions of the original tracks, as well as some rare demos and live performances. The album is available on various streaming platforms, such as Apple Music[^2^], Spotify and YouTube[^3^]. Fans can also download the album as a .rar file from Google Drive[^1^], which contains all the songs in mp3 format.
 
*Let Go* is widely regarded as one of the best pop albums of the 2000s, and has influenced many artists in the pop-rock genre, such as Kelly Clarkson, Paramore, Taylor Swift, Olivia Rodrigo and Billie Eilish. Lavigne herself has continued to release music over the years, with her latest single "Love Sux" coming out in October 2021.
  
Lavigne's life and career have not been without challenges. In 2014, she revealed that she had been diagnosed with Lyme disease, a bacterial infection that can cause fatigue, joint pain and neurological problems. She said that she had been bedridden for five months and had difficulty breathing and talking. She credited her fans and her then-husband Chad Kroeger, the lead singer of Nickelback, for their support during her recovery. [16] [17]
 
Lavigne also faced some controversies over her musical choices. In 2018, she released the song \"Head Above Water\", which was inspired by her battle with Lyme disease and expressed her faith in God. Some critics accused her of abandoning her punk roots and becoming a Christian artist. Lavigne defended herself, saying that she was not trying to fit into any genre and that she was simply expressing her personal feelings. [18] [19]
 
In 2022, Lavigne returned to her pop-punk style with her seventh studio album, Love Sux, which featured collaborations with artists such as Mod Sun, Machine Gun Kelly and Travis Barker. The album received positive reviews from critics and fans, who praised Lavigne for staying true to herself and delivering catchy and energetic songs. [20] [21]
 
Lavigne has sold over 40 million albums and 50 million singles worldwide, making her one of the best-selling artists of all time. She has also won numerous awards, including eight Grammy Award nominations, two MTV Video Music Awards, two World Music Awards and three Juno Awards. She has also been involved in various charitable causes, such as the Avril Lavigne Foundation, which supports children and young people with serious illnesses or disabilities. [22] [23]
