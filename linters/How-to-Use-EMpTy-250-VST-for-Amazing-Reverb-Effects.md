## What is EMpTy 250 VST?
 
EMpTy 250 VST is a software reverb plugin based on the EMT-250, a rare and expensive hardware unit that was used on many famous recordings in the 70s and 80s. The EMT-250 is known for its sweet and smooth character, as well as its versatility and ease of use. It can create anything from subtle ambience to lush hall reverbs, and it has a distinctive metallic tone that adds warmth and richness to any sound.
 
EMpTy 250 VST is a faithful reproduction of the original schematics, with adjustable parameters such as reverb decay time, low frequency response, high frequency response, predelay, and dry-wet ratio. It also has an additional low-pass filter to create darker sounds, and an alternative "modern" mode that offers more flexibility and control. EMpTy 250 VST is available as a VST, VST3, AU and AAX plugin for Windows and Mac OS X.
  
## How to Use EMpTy 250 VST?
 
Using EMpTy 250 VST is very simple and intuitive, as it has a minimalistic interface that resembles the original hardware unit. Here are some steps to follow:
 
1. Load EMpTy 250 VST as an insert or send effect on the track or bus that you want to apply reverb to.
2. Select one of the presets from the drop-down menu, or tweak the knobs to create your own settings.
3. Adjust the decay time knob to set how long the reverb tail lasts. The range is from 0.4 to 5 seconds.
4. Adjust the low frequency response knob to set how much low-end is present in the reverb signal. The range is from -12 dB to +12 dB.
5. Adjust the high frequency response knob to set how much high-end is present in the reverb signal. The range is from -12 dB to +12 dB.
6. Adjust the predelay knob to set how much time there is between the dry signal and the onset of the reverb. The range is from 0 ms to 100 ms.
7. Adjust the dry-wet ratio knob to set how much of the original signal is mixed with the reverb signal. The range is from 0% (dry) to 100% (wet).
8. If you want to create darker sounds, turn on the low-pass filter switch and adjust the cutoff frequency knob. The range is from 20 Hz to 20 kHz.
9. If you want to try a different mode of operation, turn on the modern switch and adjust the feedback knob. The range is from -100% (reverse) to +100% (normal).

You can also use automation or MIDI control to change any of these parameters in real time.
